# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Network
This project is a neural network-based solution for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The implementation leverages TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model.

## Features

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture

- Data preprocessing and augmentation

- Model training and evaluation

- Visualization of results

## Installation

1. Ensure you have git installed, and then clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiraeth12/handwritten-recognition
```
2. Change Directory
```bash
cd handwritten-recognition
```
4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook Hand_Written_Recognition_Neural_Network.ipynb
```

## Datasets
The MNIST dataset is used for training and testing. It is automatically downloaded when running the script.

## Model Architecture
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max pooling layers for down-sampling
- Dense layers for classification
- Dropout for regularization

## Results
The model achieves high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits. Accuracy and loss metrics are visualized during training.
